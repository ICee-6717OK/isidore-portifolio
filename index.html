						<h2>About Me.</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Education</li>
							<p>Having completed my highschool from <em>Utumishi Academy</em>, I was enrolled to Taita Taveta University to undertake a course in Geoinformatics. Down the line, (due to various reasons) I dropped out to fully persue a programming course at Moringa School in order to up my game and improve my programming skills too.</p>
							
							<li>Job Experience.</li>
							<p>Being a 21 year old in Kenya is as challenging as you would imagine. From various part-time jobs, none being involved with my actual passion for computer programming, I did anything across the board to be able to sustain myself.</p>
						
						<li>Why Moringa?</li>
						<p><span>"If you do what you like for a career, you won't ever work in your life!" (Anonymus)</span>. This being my life's philosophy, I had to find a place that I would get quality education about programmimg, and Moringa does just that!</p>
						
					<li>Hobbies and Interests.</li>
					<ol class="hobby">
						<li>Listening to rock music.</li>
						<li>Playing video games.</li>
						<li>Watching Anime.</li>
						<li>Eating!</li>
